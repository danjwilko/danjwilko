### About Me

I'm transitioning from a hands-on technical background into a career in the tech sector, with my main focus on development and cybersecurity. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve studied and developed skills across:

- Algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming (Python, Java)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS)
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (Linux, networking, privilege escalation, web app vulns)

I'm currently working through the TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester pathway, with plans to complete both the JPT1 certification and CompTIA Security+ by the end of 2025. Also preparing for my next set of Uni modules: TM351 Data management and analysis which I've just started and then TM359 Systems Penetration Testing, which starts early next year.
